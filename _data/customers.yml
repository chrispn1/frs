  quote: Prior to the implementation of Invest|Pro™ the preparation of a set of investment accounts from multiple different systems was quite inefficient. Having a single database of investment transactions and a single Invest|Pro™ general ledger from which to extract a trial balance has significantly reduced timescales and greatly improved the robustness of the process.Invest|Pro™ has completely transformed our operations.
