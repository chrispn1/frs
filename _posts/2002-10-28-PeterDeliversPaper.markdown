Managing Director Mr. Peter Caslin of Financial Risk Solutions (FRS), a leading fund administration software company, delivered a paper entitled “Alternative Investments for Life Assurance Companies and Pension Funds” to a gathering of 200 fund administration industry professionals at London’s Radisson Edwardian Hotel. The main purpose of the paper was to review the issues that arise for life assurance companies, product development actuaries and appointed actuaries in relation to unit linked life assurance products where the link is to some form of ‘alternative’ investment. The paper also briefly looks at the issues that arise for pension funds.
