The worlds largest insurance group has implemented Financial Risk Solutions (FRS) fund administration system Invest|Pro for the investment administration of its UK, Irish and the Isle of Man life assurance businesses.

Dublin based FRS specialises in providing investment administration systems for the life assurance industry.

Invest|Pro administers collective unitised funds, portfolio bonds and self invested pensions. The system calculates unit prices, accounts for tax, management charges, provides regulatory reporting and manages investment and financial accounting.

Frank Carr, sales & marketing director at FRS commenting said;

*"We are extremely happy with this outstanding endorsement of our system from one of the most respected global insurers. We were competing against the best the worlds fund admin software sector has to offer and we won because FRS understands the sector better than our contemporaries and we deliver systems that add measurable value to our customers, all of whom are reference sites."*
