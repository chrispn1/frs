Towers Perrin Tillinghast (Tillinghast) and Financial Risk Solutions (“FRS”) have entered into an exclusive agreement to distribute Invest|Pro in the UK.

FRSs Invest|Pro is an investment administration system which enables financial institutions to efficiently manage collective unitised funds, personalised portfolio bonds and self invested pensions. FRS is an Irish company founded by a group of actuaries in 1999.

Existing Invest|Pro clients are based in Ireland, Italy and the Isle of Man and include Norwich Union International, Sanpaolo Life and Irish Life International.

Italy, Germany, France, Holland, Belgium, Spain, Sweden, Denmark and Finland are also covered by the agreement.

Andy Aldridge, Tillinghast managing principal in the UK, comments Tillinghast has a strong history of providing practical solutions to Financial Services companies and we see Invest|Pro as being a key component of our offering in the fund management arena. FRS has already built a strong reputation with Invest|Pro. It is Ireland’s most widely-used fund administration system, both with domestic life companies and importantly with international life companies based in Dublins International Financial Services Centre. Dublin is one of the worlds leading fund administration centres and together with FRS we aim to promote the use of Invest|Pro in the UK and continental Europe.


Peter Caslin FRS, CEO said;

*"The synergies between Tillinghast & FRS are such that both companies can add significant value to the back office investment administration function of life assurance companies throughout Europe and increase the range of investment products offered by these companies."*

*"This is a good example of teaming up where it makes sense, FRS has the software system and IT expertise and Tillinghast has the relationships and implementation footprint in Europe to successfully deploy Invest|Pro widely in the market. Today is a good day for both companies."*
