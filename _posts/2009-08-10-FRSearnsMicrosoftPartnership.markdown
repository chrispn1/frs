Irish company Financial Risk Solutions (FRS) today announced it has earned Certified Status in Microsofts Partner Program recognizing FRSs significant position in the Fund and Investment administration technology marketplace.

Making the announcement on the companys new status, FRS MD Peter Caslin, said, Earning Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program is a milestone we are proud of. For our customers, the Certified Partner status reinforces our expertise and relationship with Microsoft and it is a clear indication of the quality of our products.

FRS was founded by a group of senior actuaries and IT professionals nine years ago and uniquely serves customers involved in extremely complex processes in the finance departments of life assurance companies. Every day, InvestPro securely carries out valuations and administers the assets in funds worth billions of Euro. Most of these fund prices are published in the financial pages of the relevant media outlets in clients jurisdictions and ultimately these figures represent the days value of an individuals pension.

Assisting specialist software companies deliver excellence in their chosen markets is an important strategic role at Microsoft, we are always happy to assist and see success at other software companies and to see wide usage of systems that have addressed key needs in this case in the life and pensions industry, said Colin Cassidy, Partner Strategy and Programmes Manager, Microsoft Ireland.

InvestPro is used by life assurance companies, fund administrators and third party administrators across Europe. InvestPro is a pricing, accounting and investment administration system. Clients include Aviva, Eureko and Accenture Insurance Services.

Microsoft Partners are required to meet rigorous requirements for certification and expertise. FRS InvestPro has reached the status of Certified Partner for independent software vendor and software solution by demonstrating increased levels of developer certification, deep real-world experience, and by providing completed customer reference projects that were independently verified by Microsoft.
