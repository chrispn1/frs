The paper [*"Placing Value on Tax Losses in the Unit Pricing of Life Company Internal Funds"*](http://www.frsltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Placing-Value-on-Tax-Losses.pdf), examines for both expanding and contracting ‘I-E’ funds:

- philosophical problems with some of the current approaches to placing value of tax losses;
- the circumstances in which value may reasonably be placed on tax losses;
- algorithms for placing a value on tax losses; and
- methods for judging the merits of algorithms for placing value on tax losses.

In the paper the unit pricing implications of using different tax loss value algorithms is illustrated graphically.
