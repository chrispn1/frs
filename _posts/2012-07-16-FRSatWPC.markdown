Over the four days there was time to connect with other partners to share best practices, trade ideas, and leverage opportunities. Lastly FRS met with Microsoft leaders to learn about the latest innovations that can add value in the life & pensions industry.

Over 16,000 attendees from 150 countries were reminded that Microsoft earns 95% of its $70 bn revenue through its partners.
