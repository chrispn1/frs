**Dublin, {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}** – Financial Risk Solutions Limited (FRS), a leading provider of unit pricing and investment administration software for the Life Assurance and Pensions industries, has published new analysis into unit creation and investment processes in unit-linked funds for life companies.

This analysis, the second in the series from FRS, looks at unit creation and investment process in the context of ‘fair calculation of policy holder benefits’ – one of the key risks to be assessed in the current Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) review into the management and governance of unit-linked funds.

Titled ‘Unit-Linked Funds: Unit Creation and Investment Processes’, the report examines what a company should be aiming to achieve in establishing robust business processes in these areas and outlines solutions to meet both business process timelines and equity in unit pricing requirements.
