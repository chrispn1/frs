- InvestPro™ technology from Financial Risk Solutions adopted to manage complex Fund-of-funds administration
- Has already allowed them to grow the number of funds under management and win new business

**Dublin, {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}** – Investment Solutions Limited, the UK arm of one of the largest multi-manager asset managers in the world, has become the latest Life Company to adopt InvestPro™ technology  to manage its fund administration.

The software from Financial Risk Solutions (FRS) has been implemented to manage its complex Fund-of-Funds administration more efficiently and with less risk.

Investment Solutions Limited operates a complex range of unit-linked Fund of Funds, with a base layer of 130 funds and a further nine layers of 770 funds in the hierarchy.  Prior to adopting InvestPro™, a number of different systems were used to manage the different parts of the overall administration process ie different systems for unit pricing, unit dealing and cash allocation, order management and investment accounting.

Since going live with InvestPro™, this is all managed via one system, enabling Investment Solutions Limited to:

- Manage complex fund structures on different pricing bases
- Significantly reduce operational risk
- Grow business without a corresponding increase in costs

Adrian Swales, CEO Investment Solutions says, “The FRS team and the InvestPro™ system have transformed the operational efficiency of our fund-of-funds business. InvestPro™ has allowed us to double our funds under management and expand our range of funds without any increase in staff. It also allowed us to move to a true forward pricing basis for some funds while maintaining the existing processes for other funds. We consider using InvestPro™ to be a significant factor in our ability to win new business.”

Peter Caslin, CEO of FRS comments “We are pleased that Investment Solutions has chosen to select InvestPro™ as the solution for their complex fund administration requirements. The ability to streamline and better manage complex fund structures ultimately generates cost efficiencies  – and Investment Solutions are already seeing this first hand.”
