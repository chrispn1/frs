*Dublin May 8 2014* – Investors Trust, a Cayman-regulated international life assurance company, which specialises in unit-linked investment products, has adopted Invest|Pro™ software.  Under an initial 5-year license, the software will be used to manage all investment administration including daily valuations, trading, charges and corporate actions for its new portfolio bond business in Latin America, Asia and Africa.  It is the first Cayman-regulated life assurance company to adopt Invest|Pro™.

The Invest|Pro™ software is developed and licensed by Dublin Company Financial Risk Solutions (FRS). The system was delivered and installed for testing 24 hours after the license agreement was concluded.

In addition to Invest|Pro™, Investors Trust have also licensed Invest|Retail™, an FRS white-labelled web application which allows brokers and policyholders to see valuation statements, place trades, request withdrawals and manage their personal portfolios directly over the web and in real time.

Ariel Amigo, Chief Marketing Officer at Investors Trust, says, “With the launch of our new portfolio bond business, we wanted our investment administration to be as secure, efficient and scalable as possible so that we can focus on providing great products for our clients.  The Invest|Pro™ software allows us to do exactly that, and FRS has done an excellent job in understanding our requirements and providing a system to do exactly what we need for our growing international client base.”

“Having an international life company like Investors Trust is testament to the strength of our system,” says Frank Carr, CMO at FRS. “We are pleased that Invest|Pro™ is the chosen solution to manage their complex investment administration requirements and assist their international growth.”

Invest|Pro™ is already a well-recognised system in the life assurance investment administration market in Europe. FRS’s customers are some of the biggest brands in life assurance and business process outsourcing (BPO).
