The [FStech Awards](http://www.fstech.co.uk/awards/index.php), which are now in their 17th year, recognise excellence and innovation in the field of information technology within the UK and EMEA financial services sector.

-	customer service
-	systems integration
-	social media
-	outsourcing
-	data governance
-	mobile
-	online 

FRS is thrilled to be in the running for two awards this year, endorsing the company’s decision to adopt a strategy of launching a tech-reg software product, InvestGRC™, an oversight software product InvestOPS™ and dividing the InvestPro™ software suite into component parts to address specific investment administration risk management areas, is the right decision for the business - and their customers. 

InvestPro™ is available in three different software delivery models, namely; on-premises, SaaS hosted on Microsoft Azure, and delivery by a licensed FRS outsource partner, making it a scalable, cost-effective solution, which completely meets the requirements of fund administration in one system.  


The GRC module (Governance, Risk & Compliance) provides a centralised data warehouse to aggregate asset positions and other relevant compliance and risk management data and automatically produces Solvency II quantitative reporting templates (QRT) on a client-specified frequent basis.  It also allows Insurers to conduct their own risk and solvency assessments on their investment-related business.

Chief Marketing Officer at FRS, Frank Carr said; <br>
 *“Hosting our software on Microsoft Azure allows us to provide our clients with a speedy and straightforward implementation process which provides a robust, flexible solution without the need for additional infrastructure or resources. This is extremely valuable for many life assurance companies today in assisting them with their increasing administration, reporting and compliance demands while supporting their growth objectives.”* <br>
The awards are independently judged and the winners will be announced at the FStech Awards Gala Dinner & Ceremony at the London Marriott Hotel, Grosvenor Square, 23rd March 2017.
