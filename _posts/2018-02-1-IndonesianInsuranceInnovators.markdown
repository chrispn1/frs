We are pleased to be sponsoring the ‘Insurance Innovators: Indonesia 2018’ conference, which is being held in Jakarta 13 - 14th February, and both CMO Frank Carr and Head of Asia Matt Baldwin will be attending. Indonesia is arguably the most exciting insurance market in the world, with a large and rapidly growing population ready to take advantage of new services offered in the digital age. This conference aims to bring together key stakeholders to share knowledge and forge relationships, between established providers and challengers, local companies and global corporations, the huge incumbents and the newer entrants investing. Speakers include Alex Kimura, Chief Strategy Officer at Aviva Asia, Philippe Danieleski, President Director at Zurich Indonesia and Frank who will be speaking on InsurTech and FRS’ experience of automating investment linked fund administration globally. If you’re also visiting the conference, please drop Matt an email at [Matthew.Baldwin@frsltd.com](mailto:matthew.baldwin@frsltd.com).
