We are pleased to be the main sponsor of the Unit Pricing 2018 Forum in Sydney, Australia which is taking place on 21st â€“ 23rd May 2018. The conference is specifically for executives working in the unit pricing, tax, audit, finance, risk and compliance areas of superannuation funds and the managed funds industry. Since 1992 when superannuation schemes were introduced, Australia has become one of the best-funded countries in the world in terms of retirement income, with more than $2 trillion AUM and significantly growing from mandatory contributions. After our recent successful expansion into Asia, Australia is a key target geography for FRS and our core investment administration solution, InvestPro, is well placed to meet the needs of the Australian market. If you are attending the conference, and wish to meet with the FRS team, please email [matthew.baldwin@frsltd.com](mailto:matthew.baldwin@frsltd.com) directly.
