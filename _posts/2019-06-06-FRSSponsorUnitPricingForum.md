**Sydney, AU - {{ page.date | date_to_long_string }}**

*Firm to share lessons learned from 60+ unit pricing projects with global, blue chip clients*

<br>
Financial Risk Solutions (FRS), award-winning provider of fund administration software to global life assurance and asset management companies, today announced their lead sponsorship of [International Business Review (IBR) Conferences Unit Pricing Forum](https://ibrc.com.au/event/unit-pricing-2019-forum-3/){:target="_blank"}, at the Grace Hotel Sydney, from 12th to 14th June, 2019.
<br>

The conference provides executives working in the unit pricing, tax, audit, finance, risk and compliance areas of superannuation funds and the managed funds industry, insight into the critical functions of risk management, controls and compliance, and will this year explore the future of unit pricing from a regulatory standpoint, real time transacting and the Self-Managed Accounts (SMA) alternative.

<br>

Matthew Baldwin, Managing Director for APAC at FRS, said:
<br>

*"The Unit Pricing Forum in Sydney is widely respected as one of the best industry events and we are delighted to be sponsoring the forum for the second year running. With the introduction of auto-enrolment superannuation in Australia thirty years ago, the country is a true leader in the space. Now that we’re seeing other countries implement auto-enrolment pensions schemes it signals a very bright future for our industry indeed."*
<br>

He continued:
<br>

*"As we celebrate twenty years providing software to global life and asset management companies at FRS, we are proud to share our extensive knowledge and experience at this forum and help to improve standards."*

<br>

In a presentation titled **‘Lessons Learned from 60+ unit pricing projects,’** Matthew will explore some of today’s biggest challenges in unit pricing and introduce the firm’s Optimum Operating Model.  
<br>
FRS’s Optimum Operating Model draws on detailed industry knowledge and blue chip client base, along with the extensive functionality in the InvestPro™ platform. It offers automation, rules based validation and interactive data visualisation whilst providing comprehensive investment accounting and fund administration functionality in a single platform.
<br>

FRS’s focus is the automating of the fund administration process to drive operational efficiency whilst reducing operational risk across the complex and time sensitive activities, leading to the generation of unit prices.
<br>

In April, 2019 FRS announced its [entry into the Australian market](http://www.frsltd.com/jekyll/update/2019/04/23/EnteringAustralianMarket.html){:target="_blank"} driven by industry demand for the InvestPro™ system.
