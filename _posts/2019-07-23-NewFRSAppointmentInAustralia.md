**Sydney, AU**

*Cian O’Driscoll relocates to Sydney to onboard clients on the InvestPro™ platform*

<br>
Financial Risk Solutions (FRS), the award-winning provider of unit linked fund administration software to global life assurance and asset management companies, is pleased to announce further expansion of its APAC presence with senior software consultant, Cian O’Driscoll, moving to Australia to take on the role of Implementation Manager. He joins Managing Director for the region, Matthew Baldwin.
<br>

O’Driscoll relocated from FRS’ Dublin headquarters to Sydney in April and is responsible for onboarding new clients onto the InvestPro™ platform. Celebrating twenty years in business this year and with over sixty implementations of InvestPro™ globally, FRS has built a solid reputation on the level of expertise and hands-on support provided by their technical team. Central to the FRS DNA is offering both a software solution and the industry and domain expertise that is required to design effective operating models specific to client needs using InvestPro™ and InvestRetail™.  

<br>

Matthew Baldwin, Managing Director for APAC at FRS, said:
<br>

*"InvestPro™ automates the fund administration process to drive efficiency and reduce risk in operations, which means successful onboarding is critical to our clients realising these benefits immediately. Cian has been with FRS since 2015. He has a deep technical understanding of the software and is expert at leading implementations with new clients. It’s great to have him here."*
<br>

Earlier this year FRS announced its [entry into the Australian market](http://www.frsltd.com/jekyll/update/2019/04/23/EnteringAustralianMarket.html){:target="_blank"} driven by industry demand for the InvestPro™ system. The company is onboarding InvestPro™ at one of Australia’s leading fund groups. The software is available on premise or in a cloud deployment on Microsoft Azure locally in Australia.
