*Stand-alone module on the InvestPro™ platform helps wealth, life and asset managers comply with new tax rules.*

<br>
Financial Risk Solutions (FRS), the award-winning provider of fund administration software to global life assurance and asset management companies, today announced the launch of InvestTax™ for fund managers to calculate and report capital gains tax (CGT) on real estate investments for non-UK residents.
<br>

The new module on the InvestPro™ platform was developed in response to new tax rules, introduced in April 2019 by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), that will see CGT applied to gains made by non-UK residents on their sales of UK real estate. This includes non-UK resident investors who invest in UK-based funds that are at least 75 per cent UK real estate invested. 

<br>
Available as a stand-alone module, InvestTax™ automates the process and calculation of CGT on property assets at an individual fund level and at the corporate level. It helps wealth, asset managers and life companies to:

*	Comply with new tax rules and report CGT tax owed by non-UK residents for the 2019 - 2020 tax year and each year following this
*	Realise efficiency gains by automating the process and calculation of CGT
*	Reduce risk through automated processing and a robust audit trail
*	Manage the corporate level CGT return
<br>
Frank Carr, Chief Marketing Officer at FRS, commented:

An agile approach allows us to respond with technology solutions that ensure our clients stay compliant without holding up their day-to-day operations."* 
<br>
<br>
*"InvestTax™ has been welcomed by clients, and they are well-placed to comply with the new UK capital gains tax rules for non-residents, ahead of the reporting deadline."*
