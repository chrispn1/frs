<p><strong>Dealing</strong>
Invest|Pro™ manages and tracks the deal status for trades from initial order placement through to settlement. Dealing can be automated using Swift messaging. Trades in the same asset can be aggregated across multiple individual accounts to obtain a single market order. Invest|Pro™ has in-built pre-trade validation, eg, the individual account has sufficient cash to purchase a security or sufficient nominal of the security for a sale. Clients can view contract notes over the web.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Issues</strong>
Invest|Pro™ displays all individual accounts holding the relevant security at the notification date. For each holding, Invest|Pro allows the user to add new units/shares to the holding at zero cost.</p>
