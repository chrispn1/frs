<p><strong>Daily individual account valuations</strong> can be scheduled to run automatically or can be created manually. The automated process requires that the latest asset price feeds and FX rates are available prior to the scheduled run time.</p>
<p><strong>New Business</strong> Invest|Pro™ creates a new individual account based on a message from the company’s existing CRM system. A new individual account can also be created through an Invest|Pro™ user interface. Cash can be applied to the individual account based on a message from the CRM system (or through an Invest | Pro™ user interface).</p>
<p><strong>Settlements</strong> Invest|Pro™ can automate settlement of trades which settle through CREST or Euroclear. For assets which require direct settlement with a settlement counterparty Invest | Pro™ can create a settlement extract for uploading to a banking settlement system or to an internal company payment system.</p>
<p><strong>Management charges</strong> are accrued in the daily valuation process. Charges can be deducted monthly/quarterly etc. on a calendar basis or on the anniversary of the individual account start date. Individual accounts can have multiple types of charges comprising, eg. </p>
<ul>
<li>Transaction charges, eg, dealing charges, custody charges, settlement charges etc. </li>
<li>Asset based charges/rebates, eg, a rebate from a fund manager in respect of a specific security holding </li>
<li>Flat administration fees - Performance fees, eg, 10% of the growth in excess of a hurdle rate </li>
<li>Fees based on size of funds under management, eg, annual management charge, fund adviser fees, establishment charges, exit penalties, safe keeping fees etc:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assets Managed</strong> Invest|Pro™ manages the main assets classes ie, equities, collectives, EFT’s, fixed/floating rate bonds, property, overnight and fixed term bank deposits and exchange traded futures and options. An asset must be authorized by a user with appropriate rights before it becomes available for trading. Each asset is linked to one or more settlement counterparties. A settlement counterparty must be authorized by two or more users with appropriate rights before transactions can take place with this counterparty. Products can be confi gured on Invest|Pro™ so that only defined sets of assets (or the full universe of assets) are available to be traded on each product.</p>
<p><strong>Dealing</strong>
Invest|Pro™ manages and tracks the deal status for trades from initial order placement through to settlement. Dealing can be automated using Swift messaging. Trades in the same asset can be aggregated across multiple individual accounts to obtain a single market order. Invest|Pro™ has in-built pre-trade validation, eg, the individual account has sufficient cash to purchase a security or sufficient nominal of the security for a sale. Clients can view contract notes over the web.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Issues</strong>
Invest|Pro™ displays all individual accounts holding the relevant security at the notification date. For each holding, Invest|Pro allows the user to add new units/shares to the holding at zero cost.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Actions</strong>
Invest|Pro™ supports dividend accrual and payment processing at asset level (including the processing of equalization on UK collectives). Payments can also be processed as scrip dividends. For UK life companies the tax treatment of dividends from UK equity and bond collectives is also catered for. In addition to this, Invest|Pro™ supports the following corporate actions:</p>
<p>Security transformations and splits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights issues</li>
<li>Bonus issues</li>
<li>Rights Issues</li>
</ul>
<p>Invest|Pro™ produces a report that lists all individual accounts holding the relevant security on the given date. The report will include account cross reference, so that the clients can be contacted to request confirmation of action to be taken.</p>
<p><strong>Security Transformations/Splits</strong>
Invest|Pro™ displays all individual accounts holding the relevant security at the notification date. The system generates the transactions to reflect the post action position.</p>
<p><strong>Cash Accounts</strong> Cash balances can be held in multiple currencies. Interest can be applied to cash balances based on the product to which the account is linked, the size of the balance, the sign of the balance, the currency of the balance and by date. This can be an automated scheduled process or done manually by a user. Interest, dividends, rebates from external funds etc. are added to and charges and expenses deducted from the individual account currency.</p>
<p><strong>Audit Backup</strong> There is full back up for audit purposes to the financial statements data. For example, schedules showing the opening, closing and movements in book cost, realised gains and unrealised gains at security level are available between any two reporting dates through the Reports module.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Currency</strong> Invest|Pro™ is a multi-currency application. The system currency is the currency used for production of the company’s financial statements. The individual account currency is the currency in which valuations of the individual account are produced (this can vary by individual account). The asset currency is the currency in which asset prices are quoted (this varies by asset). Each day Invest|Pro receives an automated FX feed.</p>
