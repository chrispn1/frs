<ul>
<li>Meet your regulatory requirements for BPO control</li>

<li>Monitor your investment data by creating performance metrics with sophisticated alerting functionality if breaches occur</li>

</ul>
<p>To effectively monitor the contractual requirements that your outsourced partners need to adhere to, your company needs to establish open data flow and performance metrics with the outsourcer.
Regulatory and corporate governance standards now require you to closely manage and control the activities BPO providers carry out on your behalf. </p>
<p>With Invest|Pro™ you can efficiently view BPO data on a cloud or host in your own environment. Data transferred from the BPO provider can be used to in-source enterprise critical activities on the Invest|Pro™ system in the case of BPO failure. </p>
