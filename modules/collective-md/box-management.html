    Invest|Pro™ supports both a long term and short term box fund and full financial accounting and fund performance is available for the box funds just as it is for any other fund. The four most commonly used market methods of appropriations (matching units with policyholder money flows, i.e. cancelling units for surrenders and creating units in the case of new money flows) are forecast matching, deferred matching, backdated matching and seeding of funds. Invest|Pro™ supports all of these methods and a mixture of these approaches. The method used sometimes depends on the functionality of the policy processing system and on its ability to provide forecasts to Invest|Pro™. <br />
