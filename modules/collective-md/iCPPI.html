<ul class="whitebullets">
	Recently a new generation of life assurance product has emerged which oﬀers individual policyholders the following beneﬁts:

<li>Gives access to investment data via a web based reporting control tool</li>
<li>Create your own personal drilldown reports on any data held in the investment databases and other connected databases</li>
<li>Share and schedule reports with other users</li>
<li>View reports on touch enabled devices such as smart phones and tablets</li>
</ul>
<p>Invest|Pro™ Analytics is a reporting tool which connects the user to the business processes running on the Invest|Pro™ Server. It is a powerful web based business intelligence tool for life office investment administration. Due to our highly optimised report design on Analytics, the user remotely can create and quickly view reports on huge datasets (&gt;10 million rows). </p>
<p>Analytics can also be quickly configured to access data outside the Invest|Pro™ databases. This allows clients to use the system as their general reporting tool within the enterprise and allow the creation of rich multi database reports to support better decision making by management.
