<ul class="whitebullets">
	Recently a new generation of life assurance product has emerged which oﬀers individual policyholders the following beneﬁts:

<li>Gives access to investment data via a web based reporting control tool</li>
<li>Create your own personal drilldown reports on any data held in the investment databases and other connected databases</li>
<li>Share and schedule reports with other users</li>
<li>View reports on touch enabled devices such as smart phones and tablets</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence iCPPi oﬀers protection against a chosen percentage of an individual’s investment (say 80%) so that in falling markets, the strategy allocates more towards the safer assets, while in improving markets, the strategy allocates more to the risky assets. By taking this approach the iCPPI product undertakes to best manage this trade-oﬀ between returns from risky assets and the cost of protecting the individual policyholders investment. </p>
<p>In addition, there is typically a good choice of best-of-breed investment managers’ funds and bond providers for the investor and their advisor to choose from.
