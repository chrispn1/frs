intro: The life assurance business is all about the flow of data into and out of your fund admin system. In order to ensure correct pricing it is vital to ensure that this data is correct. However as funds increase in size and complexity this becomes harder and harder to manage manually. The exceptions system is designed to allow users specify rules that can be run before or after tasks to check that specified parameters are within specified bounds. Notifications are sent if an error is detected and errors can block subsequent processes until signed off.

 - Duplicate exceptions for a given process will not be created
