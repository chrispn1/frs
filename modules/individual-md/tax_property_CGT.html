<ul class = "whitebullets">
<p>Available as a stand-alone module, Invest|Tax™ automates the process and calculation of capital gains tax on property assets at an individual fund level and at the corporate level. It helps wealth, asset man-agers and life companies to:</p>
<li>Comply with new tax rules and report CGT tax owed by non-UK residents for the 2019 - 2020 tax year and each year following this</li>
<li>Realise efficiency gains by automating the process and calculation of capital gains tax</li>
<li>Reduce risk through automated processing and a robust audit trail</li>
<li>Manage the corporate level capital gains tax return</li>
</ul>
<p>The new module on the Invest|Pro™ platform was developed in response to new tax rules, introduced in April 2019 by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), that will see capital gains tax applied to gains made by non-UK residents on their sales of UK real estate. This includes non-UK resident investors who invest in UK-based funds that are at least 75 per cent UK real estate invested.</p>
