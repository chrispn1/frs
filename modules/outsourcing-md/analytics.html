<p>Invest|Pro™ Analytics is a reporting tool which connects the user to the business processes running on the Invest|Pro™ Server. It is a powerful web based business intelligence tool for life office investment administration. Due to our highly optimised report design on Analytics, the user remotely can create and quickly view reports on huge datasets (&gt;10 million rows). </p>
<p>Analytics can also be quickly configured to access data outside the Invest|Pro™ databases. This allows clients to use the system as their general reporting tool within the enterprise and allow the creation of rich multi database reports to support better decision making by management.</p>
