<h3 id="what-is-does-for-you">What it does for you</h3>
<ul class="whitebullets">
<li>Manage and control trades through the trading life cycle from creation to settlement</li>
<li>Trade efficiently and error free with pre-built links to multiple external trading platforms and settlement counterparties </li>
<li>Scalable solution capable of handling millions of transactions per day, aggregating trades where possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Invest|Pro™ manages and tracks the status for asset transactions from initial order creation through to settlement. This trading workflow is customizable for different the security categories. </p>
<p>On Invest|ProTM trade orders are sourced from the unit creation process (for collective funds) or via the Invest|Retail web portal for individual portfolios. Orders can also arise from a rebalancing exercise or where the portfolios are linked to a model portfolio which changes. Alternatively, the Invest|Pro UI allows investment professionals enter trades via a trading screen. </p>
<p>Using Invest|Pro’s trading validation algorithms, trading parameters are checked and may be forced through authorisation processes if necessary.</p>
