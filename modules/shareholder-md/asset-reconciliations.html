<p>Asset and bank reconciliations are the single greatest weapon against corruption of the investment database. However due to the non-standard format of custodian and bank files and the manual effort that this brings to the process it is usually unfeasible to carry out these checks as often as you would like to. With Invest|Proâ„¢ we have used our datapump technology to allow virtually any electronic format issued by a bank or custodian to be imported into the system and used to carry out the reconciliations on a daily basis. </p>
