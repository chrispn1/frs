<h3>Asset reporting for Solvency II – are you prepared? </h3>

Three important questions:
<br>
1. Will your ability to report on your assets be compliant with the Pillar 3 obligations on 1st Jan 2016?
<br>
2. Can your assets data be compiled, enriched, reviewed and reported on automatically, from multiple sources and diverse systems?
<br>
3. Can you present data in quantitative reporting templates (QRT) accurately, reliable and on time?
<br><br>
Invest|Comp™ – answers YES to all three.
