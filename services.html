<p>The FRS Services team are a collection of highly trained professionals that combine extensive technical expertise with significant knowledge of the issues and complexities facing their clients. By helping organisations realise the full potential of InvestPro, FRS clients are able to scale use of the platform across their operations, providing further benefits to their business and end clients.</p>
<p>Our technical experts share a common goal - putting operational users in control of their Xceptor deployment and assisting them in shaping how they manage their data and processes.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>A tried and tested project methodology ensures all implementations are delivered within an agreed client framework. WSI have a straightforward, open and honest approach to project delivery based on a track record of successful client implementations delivered time after time.</p>
<p>Our Implementation Consultants work alongside the client to ensure they gain a full appreciation of their exact requirements. Once InvestPro is deployed the implementation is centred on user configurations and business rules providing rapid and efficient project delivery, that it tailored to a clientâ€™s data and processes.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>FRS adopts a service model whereby client support is provided by the team that developed the software. Clients are provided with direct access to the InvestPro experts at our Development and Support Centre. Queries are often resolved immediately by a level of front-line support that is rarely seen in the industry.</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>FRS training programmes are interactive, example-rich courses designed to put clients in control of their own data and processes. Clients have the option of receiving the customised training in-house, remote or on-site.</p>
<p>Training usually consists of a two-day course with operational users trained to own and manage business rules within their InvestPro implementation. The course is built around hands-on exercises with best practice from real-life implementations included. Upon course completion, attendees receive a full training pack to refer to in the future, which includes all exercises, completed examples and the training manual.</p>
