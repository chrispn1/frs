<h1>How we Engage</h1>
<p>The FRS Professional Services team are a collection of highly trained professionals that combine extensive technical knowledge of the Invest|Pro™ product with vast experience of the life assurance industry. We support all our clients through discovery, development, delivery and support.</p>


<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>Our Implementation Consultants work alongside the client to ensure they gain a full appreciation of their exact requirements and recommend potential business process re-engineering opportunities. The implementation is centred on the configuration of business rules tailored to a client’s data and processes. The objective of the implementation is to create an operating model that reduces operational risk and increases operational efficiencies.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>FRS work using an agile development method. One output from the discovery is suggested enhancements to the Invest|Pro™ application. During the development cycle the enhancements are further fine-tuned with user stories and acceptance criteria agreed with the client. Previews of the enhancements are arranged in advance of delivery to ensure that what is delivered meets the client's requirements and operates as expected. This is backed up by an extensive suite of automated tests that minimise the risk of future changes impacting existing functionality.</p>

<h2>Delivery</h2>
<p>Implementation Consultants work closely with the client on delivery. This includes installation and configuration support, test support and training. FRS continue to work closely with the client when the delivery has been promoted to production environments. Training programmes are designed to put clients in control of their own data and processes and is built around hands-on exercises with best practice from real-life implementations included.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>FRS adopts a service model whereby client support is provided by the team that developed the software. Clients are provided with direct access to the Invest|Pro™ experts at our Development and Support Centre. Queries are often resolved immediately by a level of front-line support that is rarely seen in the industry.</p>
